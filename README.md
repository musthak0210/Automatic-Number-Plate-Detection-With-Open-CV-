# Automatic-Number-Plate-Detection-With-Open-CV-
This project uses \textbf{OpenCV} and \textbf{Python} to automatically detect vehicle number plates from images or video streams. It applies image processing techniques like grayscale conversion, edge detection, and contour analysis to locate and extra plate region. A pre-trained \textbf{Haar Cascade classifier} is used for accurate plate detection
